# Mike.Portfolio

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

This is a porfolio I would like to grow and change over time. This was an exciting project!

I this is a Portfolio I would like to use for the future. I have set my self up in the code to be ablt to add items down the road like links to live code and to that specific project. Also I will add social media links in the future, I have them present in code just not avaible to be seen didnt have the time/no how to add icons where i want and it look nice.

There is at the bottom of the screen a top button to take you back to the top, as well as "Get in touch" takes you to about me.
